## Compbuild Textures Realism

Compbuild Textures is a resource pack with over 1000+ unique custom vanilla models. We have one-of-a-kind features that no other resource packs have such as biome-dependent models, textures, and more! Compbuild specializes in realism and creating the most realistic environments within Minecraft. What makes the pack special is that we have furniture, flora, and a large variety of blocks to choose from.

## How to install

3. Once you've downloaded the pack, move the .ZIP folder to `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`
